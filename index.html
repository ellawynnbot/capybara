			<h1>Ella Wynn</h1>
			<p>Hello! My name is Ella Wynn and I am a third year art major focusing in game design. I am from San Diego but I have lived all over like Florida, Seattle, and even Canada. My dad works in video games which is why I am interested in game design and also because I love video games and I think creating them would be really cool. Outside of school and work I like to watch movies, draw, bake, and sometimes read. I also like going to the beach and going on hikes if they are not too hard. </p>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<!-- Note that all filenames use lowercase and no spaces -->
					<p>I am a third year art major and I have no experience with coding but I am excited to learn! I want to go into video games so I figured this class would be very useful to me. My favorite games are Tomb Raider and Assassin's Creed.</p>
