			<h1>Ella Wynn</h1>
			<p>Hello! My name is Ella Wynn and I am a third year art major focusing in game design. I am from San Diego but I have lived all over like Florida, Seattle, and even Canada. My dad works in video games which is why I am interested in game design and also because I love video games and I think creating them would be really cool. Outside of school and work I like to watch movies, draw, bake, and sometimes read. I also like going to the beach and going on hikes if they are not too hard. </p>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<!-- Note that all filenames use lowercase and no spaces -->
					<p>I am hoping that one day I will be able to open my own video game studio, which I know would be difficult but it's the goal. I would want to make a studio that would be run by more women and that appeals to all kinds of people. I really like open-world and adventure games so I would probably want to design games like that.<p></p>
