					<h2>Hello!</h2>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The main problems that I faced were figuring out where to change each detail in the css code. I had a hard time at first with knowing what abbreviations to type and what exactly needed to be done but once I got the hang of it, it became much easier.</p>
