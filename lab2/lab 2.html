					<h2>Hello!</h2>
					<p>My name is Ella and I am a third year art major, this is my first time coding. My partner JJ is a game design major and has more experience with coding. I also want to go into game design so it is nice to find a partner that shares the same interests!</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The main problems that I faced were figuring out where to change each detail in the css code. I had a hard time at first with knowing what abbreviations to type and what exactly needed to be done but once I got the hang of it, it became much easier.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I thought that this assignment went very well, I had some trouble with it at first but I enjoyed it.</p>
